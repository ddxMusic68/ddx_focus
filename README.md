## Dropbox Sync Setup

Dropbox sync requires your own Dropbox app credentials. No API keys are baked into the app.

1. Go to [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).
2. Click **Create app** and choose **Scoped access** → **Full Dropbox** (or App folder).
3. Under the **Permissions** tab, enable `files.content.write` and `files.content.read`, then click **Submit**.
4. Copy the **App key** from the app's overview page.
5. In ddxJournal, open **Settings** → **Dropbox Sync** → **Connect**.
6. Enter your App key, then authorize the app in your browser and paste the authorization code back into the app.

Once connected, use **Sync Now** in settings to sync manually. Auto-sync runs on app startup when enabled.
